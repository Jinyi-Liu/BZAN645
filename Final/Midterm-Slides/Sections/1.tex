    Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. If homes can be found for them, many precious lives can be saved --- and more happy families created. 

PetFinder.my has been Malaysia's leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more than 150,000 animals. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.

In this project, we use PetFinder.my's database to create an algorithm that predicts how quickly a pet will be adopted. From this, PetFinder can improve their pet's profile to attract more potential adopters.
