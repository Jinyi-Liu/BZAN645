\section{Background and Motivation}\label{Background} 
Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. If homes can be found for them, many precious lives can be saved --- and more happy families created. 

PetFinder.my has been Malaysia's leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more than 150,000 animals. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.

In this project, we use PetFinder.my's database to create an algorithm that predicts how quickly a pet will be adopted. From this, PetFinder can improve their pet's profile to attract more potential adopters. 

% \subsection{Objectives}


% Clearly state your objective. 

% Provide a problem formulation. 

% Justify your choice of model(s).

% For this mid-term assessment, you only need to demonstrate your ability of abstracting an application problem into a technical formuation. What is given, what do you look for, and what are the constraints or considerations (if applicable)?

% Hint: By working on this assignment, you should have tools for feature preparation, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning for insights.
% Design your experiments and show your point. E.g.,
% How do you ensure that your model is properly fit?
% If not using your current approach, what would be the alternative approaches?
% How do you evaluate the models?
% Did you tune the hyperparameters?
% For an applied paper, it is important to (1) show that your model worked the best you can; (2) discuss the practical implications.
